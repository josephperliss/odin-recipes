# odin-recipes
In this project, I will be creating an HTML webpage of a recipe.
When I have finished the webpage, I will have demonstrated my ability to use html basic commands. These include images, hyperlinks, and basic structuring.
I also will have demonstrated basic Git commands to commit and push my work.
